# World-Happiness-Report-2021
The annual World Happiness Report 2021 shows that Finland has the best ladder score out of any countries, and from the data we also get to determine the country with the worst ladder score which is Afghanistan. To know more about the detail, make sure to check on the code and visualization that I have made and posted here using Python.

Choropleth visualization of the data is provided in the Choropleth Map Images file as the visualization isn't shown in the .ipynb file.
